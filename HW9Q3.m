% The Voltage and Current relationship for a capacitor is given by the following equation:

% , where and .
% Write a MATLAB program that plots v(t) and i(t) between t=0 and t=2Ï€ on the same axes.
% (Do not use any function for the derivative in MATLAB, manually find the derivative of the
% voltage and use it in the equation).
